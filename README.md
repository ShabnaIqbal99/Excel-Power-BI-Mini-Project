Excel-Power-BI-Mini-Project
This mini-project explores flight performance across the United States using the 2015 Flight Delay and Cancellation dataset. The goal is to understand the key factors contributing to delays, cancellations, and flight punctuality using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for interactive visual analytics.

Project Overview:
•	Analyzed 5+ million flight records (2015) to uncover patterns in delays and cancellations.
•	Performed data cleaning, transformation, and feature creation using Excel and Power Query.
•	Built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with insights on flight performance by Airline, Airport, Delay Type, Time of Day and Cancellation Reasons

Tools Used: Excel • Power Query • Power BI • DAX

Insights Gained:
•	Identified airlines with highest and lowest delay rates.
•	Found airports with frequent late departures and long delays.
•	Analyzed which cancellation reasons had the largest impact.
•	Observed strong monthly/seasonal delay patterns.
